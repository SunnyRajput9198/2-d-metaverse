  //initiatorId: This parameter represents the userId of the local user (the one calling createPeer).
  // receiverId: This parameter represents the userId of the remote user (the one being connected to).
  // initiator: This parameter represents whether the local user is the initiator of the connection (true) or the receiver (false).//If true: This peer will immediately generate an SDP Offer (Session Description Protocol Offer) and send it out via its 'signal' event. It takes the active role in initiating the connection.
  // If false: This peer will wait to receive an SDP Offer from the remote peer. Once it receives an offer via peer.signal(offer), it will process it and then generate an SDP Answer, which it will send back via its 'signal' event. It takes the passive role.
  // trickle: false:
  // ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) is a framework that helps WebRTC peers find the best way to connect to each other, often involving NAT traversal and firewalls. It does this by discovering "ICE candidates" (potential network addresses).
  // Trickle ICE (when trickle is true, which is the default for SimplePeer) means that ICE candidates are generated and exchanged as soon as they are discovered. This speeds up connection setup but requires more frequent signaling messages.
  // Non-Trickle ICE (when trickle is false, as it is here) means that SimplePeer will wait until all ICE candidates have been gathered before bundling them together with the SDP (offer or answer) and sending them in a single 'signal' event.
  // Pros of trickle: false: Fewer signaling messages. Can simplify server-side routing as one large message contains all necessary initial setup info.
  // Cons of trickle: false: Can slightly delay connection setup because the peer has to wait for all candidates to be gathered before sending the initial signal. For real-time applications, trickle: true is often preferred for faster connection times. The choice here is a design decision; false might be chosen for simpler signaling logic.

       If signal is an SDP Answer: The SimplePeer instance processes the answer, sets up its remote description, and the SDP exchange is complete.
       If signal is an ICE(Interactive Connectivity Establishment) Candidate: The SimplePeer instance adds this candidate to its list of potential network paths to connect to the remote peer. This helps in NAT traversal and finding the most efficient way for data to flow directly between peers.

//This useVideoCall custom React hook provides functionality for managing video calls using WebSockets for signaling and SimplePeer for WebRTC peer-to-peer connections.

// Workflow Overview
// The core idea is to establish a WebRTC peer-to-peer connection between users for real-time video and audio communication. A WebSocket connection is used as a signaling channel to exchange metadata (like SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates) needed to set up these direct peer connections.
